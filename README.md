# nvim-unception

A plugin that leverages Neovim's built-in `RPC` functionality to simplify
opening files from within Neovim's terminal emulator without nesting sessions.

Terminal buffers will no longer enter a state of "inception" in which an
instance of Neovim is open within an instance of Neovim. Instead, the desired
files and directories will be opened by the "host" Neovim session, which
leverages `:argadd` to update its own arguments.

## Working with Git

The best way to work with git from within a terminal buffer is to make git
defer editing to the host session, and block until the host quits the buffer
being edited. This can be done by setting your git `core.editor` to pass the
`g:unception_block_while_host_edits=1` argument
(like
[this](https://github.com/samjwill/dotfiles/blob/ba56af2ff49cd23ac19fcffe7840a78c58a89c9b/.gitconfig#L5)).
Note that the terminal will be blocked and its buffer will be hidden until Neovim's `QuitPre` event is triggered for the commit buffer, after which, the terminal buffer will be restored to its original location.

Here's an example workflow with this flag set:

Alternatively, if you would like to be able to edit using Neovim directly
inside of a nested session, you can disable unception altogether by setting
your git `core.editor` to pass the `g:unception_disable=1` argument (like
[this](https://github.com/samjwill/dotfiles/blob/c59477c47867fb8f5560ba01d17722443428bc7e/.gitconfig#L5)).

Lastly, setting your `core.editor` to another file editor, such as GNU nano would also work.

## Requirements

Neovim 0.7 or later.

## Installation

#### Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):
    return {
        "samjwill/nvim-unception",
        init = function()
            -- Optional settings go here!
            -- e.g.) vim.g.unception_open_buffer_in_new_tab = true
        end
    }

#### Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

    Plug 'samjwill/nvim-unception'

## Settings

For usage details and additional options (such as opening the file buffers in
new tabs rather than the current window), see
[doc/nvim-unception.txt](https://github.com/samjwill/nvim-unception/blob/main/doc/nvim-unception.txt),
or, after installation, run `:help nvim-unception`.

## Can this work with terminal-toggling plugins?

Yep! See the [wiki](https://github.com/samjwill/nvim-unception/wiki) for setup info.

## How does it work?

The plugin tells Neovim to automatically start a local server listening to a
named pipe at launch. Upon launching a new Neovim session within a terminal
emulator buffer, the arguments are forwarded to the aforementioned Neovim
server session via the pipe, and the server session replaces the buffer under
the cursor (the terminal buffer) with the first file/directory argument
specified.

## Limitations

This plugin works well enough for me but your mileage may vary. If you
find an issue, feel free to create one detailing the problem on the
GitHub repo, and I'll try to fix it if I'm able. If you run into a
problem, Unception can be temporarily disabled when launching Neovim
like so:
`nvim --cmd "let g:unception_disable=1"`

Other Neovim command-line arguments that do not involve editing a file or
directory may not work as expected from *within* the terminal emulator (e.g.
passing `-b` to edit in binary mode when inside of a terminal buffer will not
propagate binary mode to the file when it's unnested, and opening a file as
read-only when the server session is not set to read-only mode will not result
in a read-only buffer). See `:help vim-arguments` for how these are typically
used. Note that any arguments that might not work when launched from within a
Neovim terminal buffer should work just fine when launching Neovim normally.
They should also behave as as they do by default if you pass the disable flag
described above, even if launched from within a terminal buffer.
